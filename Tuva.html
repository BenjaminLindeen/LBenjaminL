  <h1>How does the numeber of electoral collage votes that a winning presidental canidate gets
    and the number of executive orders that they make reatle to eachother?<h1>
   <p> We went and researched on tuvalabs.com to find out the relation between electoral votes and executive actions</p> 
   <h2> We found that over the last 45 years the amount of electoral vots is going down and so is 
     the amount of executive orders being made by the presidents</h2>
   <h2> Boys Prefer in this order Yellow, Orange, Green, Red, Purple</h2>
   <p> We found that girls are as likley to say that they like a color of skittle as they are not to care, but boys have a hige percentage that dont care. 
     For all of the skittle boys and girls like them about the same, while only seeing girls like purple and red more than boys do.</p>
<h2> Boys tend to not care most of the time about the color of skittle where girls care most of the time</h2>
   <p>Boys are more willing to take the test than girls. Girls take longer on the test than boys.</p>
    <p>  Girls Don't Give fake / troll responses while 30 of the boys did. </p>

<h2> Conclution, there is</h2>
    <p>Girls care more about the color of skittles, Boys think that the survey is a chance to be funny and are more willing to take it, and Green is the favorite color of Skittle.</p>
