  <h1>How does the numeber of electoral collage votes that a winning presidental canidate gets
    and the number of executive orders that they make reatle to eachother?<h1>
   <p> We went and researched on tuvalabs.com to find out the relation between electoral votes and executive actions</p> 
   <h2> We found that over the last 45 years the amount of electoral votes is going down and so is 
     the amount of executive orders being made by the presidents</h2>
   <h2> Ronald Regans got over 525 Electoral Votes in 1984 but just 20 years later 16 years later George W. Bush only got 271.</h2>
   <p>The results show that a number of Executive Actions do change with a number of Electoral Votes,
     The trend is going down for both but the president with the most 
     Electoral Vote heading into office are making more Executive actions.
     A possible reason for this is that the more electoral votes that a president gets makes him feel more 
     confident about the chance he has to get reelected in the next 
     4 year and he is more likely to make controversial or partisan actions.</p>
<h2>  President is getting less electoral votes as the time goes on, it used to be that the winning candidate 
  would win by a small landslide and that the loser really stood no chance 
  in the end but now it has changed where the winner of the election maybe be wining by just 1 electoral vote. 
  This has lead to a steep drop in the amount of executive action made by the president,  during the 
  FDR administration 3,728 were singed but just less than 1/10 of that are being signed by the current presidents.</h2>

<h2> Conclution</h2>
    <p>The elections are becoming more partisan and the president are in fear that 
      they won't be back for a second term if they make a lot of 
      executive actions which has lead the amount of them to drop</p>
