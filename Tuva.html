<h1>How does the number of electoral collage votes that a winning presidential candidate gets
    and the number of executive orders that they make relate to each other? 
  We went and researched on tuvalabs.com to find out the relation between electoral votes and executive actions<h1>
 <h2> We found that over the last 45 years a number of electoral votes are going down and so is 
     A number of executive orders being made by the presidents</h2>
   <h2> Ronald Regans got over 525 Electoral Votes in 1984 but just 20 years later 16 years later George W. Bush only got 271.</h2>
   <p>The results show that a number of Executive Actions do change with a number of Electoral Votes.
     The trend is going down for both but the president with the most 
     Electoral Vote heading into office are making more Executive actions.
     A possible reason for this is that the more electoral votes that a president gets make him feel more 
     confident about the chance he has to get reelected in the next 
     4 year and he are more likely to make controversial or partisan actions.</p>
<p>  President is getting less electoral votes as the time goes on, it used to be that the winning candidate 
  would win by a small landslide and that the loser really stood no chance in the end but now it has changed where the winner of the election maybe be winning by just 1 electoral vote. 
  This has lead to a steep drop in the amount of executive action made by the president,  during the 
  FDR administration 3,728 were signed but just less than 1/10 of that are being signed by the current presidents.</p>

<h1> Conclution</h1>
    <p>The elections are becoming more partisan and the president are in fear that 
      they won't be back for a second term if they make a lot of 
      executive actions which have to lead the amount of them to drop</p>
