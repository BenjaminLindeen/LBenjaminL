 <h1>How do peoples favorite color of skittles and their gender compare?<h1>
   <p> We gave out a survey to 65 people asking what there favorite color of skittle is and we also recordeed thier gender</p>
   <h2> Our results show that</h2>  
   <h2> Girls Prefer in this order Green, Red, Purple, Yellow, Orange</h2>
   <h2> Boys Prefer in this order Yellow, Orange, Green, Red, Purple</h2>
   <p> We found that girls are as likley to say that they like a color of skittle as they are not to care, but boys have a hige percentage that dont care. 
     For all of the skittle boys and girls like them about the same, while only seeing girls like purple and red more than boys do.</p>
<h2> Boys tend to not care most of the time about the color of skittle where girls care most of the time</h2>
   <p>Boys are more willing to take the test than girls. Girls take longer on the test than boys. Girls Don't Give fake / troll responses while some boys do. </p>
