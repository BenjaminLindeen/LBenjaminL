  <h1>How do peoples favorite color of skittles and their gender compare?<h1>
   <p> We gave out a survey to 120 people asking what there favorite color of skittle is and we also recordeed thier gender</p>
   <h2> Our results show that</h2>  
   <h2> Girls Prefer in this order Green, Red, Purple, Yellow, Orange</h2>
   <h2> Boys Prefer in this order Yellow, Orange, Green, Red, Purple</h2>
   <p> We found that girls are as likley to say that they like a color of skittle as they are not to care, but boys have a hige percentage that dont care. 
     For all of the skittle boys and girls like them about the same, while only seeing girls like purple and red more than boys do.</p>

   <p>Boys are more willing to take the test than girls. Girls take longer on the test than boys.</p>
